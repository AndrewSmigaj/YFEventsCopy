## Key Findings

### HTML Scraping Challenges
1. **JavaScript Loading**: Many modern sites load events via JavaScript, making them unscrapable with simple HTML parsing
2. **WordPress Events Calendar**: Sites using The Events Calendar plugin have consistent but complex selectors
3. **Dynamic Content**: Some events may be loaded from external APIs or require user interaction

### Successful Patterns
1. **iCal Feeds**: Reliably work and include proper time information
2. **Static HTML**: Simple gallery-style layouts work well (like Capitol Theatre)
3. **WordPress Plugin**: The Events Calendar has predictable structure

### Time Information Issue
- Most local sources don't provide specific event times in listings
- Only iCal feeds and some WordPress calendar plugins include accurate time data
- This results in many events showing as "all day" events

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Focus on iCal sources**: Find more venues offering calendar feeds
2. **Manual configuration**: Update selectors for Capitol Theatre and City of Yakima
3. **Alternative approaches**: Consider Facebook Events API integration

### Medium Term
1. **Enhanced scraping**: Implement detail page fetching for venues with landing pages
2. **API integration**: Explore Eventbrite, Facebook, or Google Events APIs
3. **Community input**: Allow manual event submission through admin panel

### Long Term
1. **JavaScript rendering**: Consider using headless browser for dynamic content
2. **RSS/Feed discovery**: Auto-detect calendar feeds on venue websites
3. **Mobile app integration**: Many venues use mobile apps for event management
