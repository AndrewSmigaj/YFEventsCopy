# Event Scraper Improvements

## Summary

The event scraper system has been tested and improved with the following enhancements:

### 1. Fixed Visit Yakima URL
- **Issue**: The original URL (https://visityakima.com/) was returning 404 for events
- **Solution**: Updated to the correct URL: https://www.visityakima.com/yakima-valley-events
- **Result**: Successfully scraped 24 events

### 2. Test Suite Created
Three comprehensive test scripts were created:

#### a. `tests/test_live_scraper.php`
- Tests scraping with temporary sources
- Checks URL accessibility 
- Finds working URLs for event sources

#### b. `tests/test_scraper_improved.php`
- Tests with actual database sources
- Discovers event-related links on websites
- Provides configuration examples for HTML scrapers

#### c. `tests/validate_scraper.php`
- Comprehensive validation suite that checks:
  - Database connectivity and schema
  - Active sources and their status
  - Data quality (duplicates, missing locations, geocoding)
  - Performance metrics
  - Provides recommendations

### 3. Key Findings

1. **Working Scrapers**:
   - Visit Yakima scraper now functional with 24 events scraped
   - iCal scraper verified working with Google Calendar feeds
   - HTML scraper framework ready for custom sources

2. **Data Quality**:
   - No duplicate events found
   - 3 events missing locations (minor issue)
   - All events with locations are properly geocoded

3. **Performance**:
   - Average scraping time: 2 seconds
   - Maximum scraping time: 3 seconds
   - System is efficient and responsive

## Usage

### Manual Scraping
```bash
# Scrape all active sources
php cron/scrape-events.php

# Scrape specific source
php cron/scrape-events.php --source-id=1
```

### Testing and Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
php tests/validate_scraper.php

# Test live scraping
php tests/test_live_scraper.php

# Find working URLs for sources
php tests/test_scraper_improved.php
```

### Update Sources
```bash
# Update Visit Yakima source
php tests/update_visit_yakima_source.php
```

## Recommendations

1. **Add More Sources**: Currently only one active source. Consider adding:
   - Local news sites (e.g., Yakima Herald)
   - Community calendars
   - Other tourism sites
   - Facebook pages or Eventbrite feeds

2. **Set Up Cron Job**: Automate daily scraping:
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /home/robug/YFEvents/cron/scrape-events.php >> /home/robug/YFEvents/logs/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance**: Use the validation script regularly to ensure:
   - Sources are being scraped successfully
   - No accumulation of duplicate events
   - Events are properly geocoded

## Next Steps

1. Add more event sources through the admin panel
2. Set up automated daily scraping via cron
3. Monitor scraping logs for any issues
4. Consider implementing the intelligent scraper for complex sources
