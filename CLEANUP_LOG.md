# Repository Cleanup Log

## Date: July 5, 2025

### Phase 1: Safe Immediate Actions (Completed)
- ✅ Removed `yakima_calendar_spec.md:Zone.Identifier` (Windows metadata)
- ✅ Removed `bin/` (empty directory)
- ✅ Removed `logs/` (empty directory)
- ✅ Removed `codebase_verification_report_2025_06_10_104450.json` (old report)
- ✅ Removed `setup_github.sh` (obsolete setup script)

### Phase 2: Safe Moves (Completed)
- ✅ Moved `add_new_calendar_sources.sql` → `database/seeds/`
- ✅ Moved `add_sources_simple.sql` → `database/seeds/`
- ✅ Moved `create_triggers.sql` → `database/`
- ✅ Moved `sample_shops.csv` → `database/fixtures/`
- ✅ Moved `sample_shops.json` → `database/fixtures/`
- ✅ Moved `codebase_mapper_v2.php` → `scripts/development/codebase_mapper.php`
- ✅ Removed `codebase_mapper.php` (old version)

### Phase 3: Security and Final Cleanup (Completed)
- ✅ Secured `system-debug.php` with admin authentication check
- ✅ Replaced `admin/index.php` with secure redirect
- ✅ Removed `admin/system-status.php` and `admin/theme-config.php` (insecure)
- ✅ Moved `css-diagnostic.php` → `public/css-diagnostic.php` (correct web root)
- ✅ Removed `www/html/css-diagnostic.php` (inaccessible duplicate)
- ✅ Archived `refactor.sh` → `docs/archive/refactor.sh` (historical reference)
- ✅ Removed `var/` directory (unused runtime directory)

### Security Improvements
1. **Removed hardcoded password** from admin interface (was 'admin123')
2. **Added authentication requirement** to system-debug.php
3. **Created secure redirect** for deprecated admin directory
4. **Consolidated duplicate files** to reduce attack surface

### File Organization Improvements
- Database scripts organized in `database/` subdirectories
- Development tools moved to `scripts/development/`
- Sample data moved to `database/fixtures/`
- Historical scripts archived in `docs/archive/`

### Notes
- The web server's DocumentRoot is `/public`, not the repository root
- All web-accessible files must be in the `/public` directory
- The `includes/` directory was kept as it's still referenced by admin files
- The main admin interface is at `/www/html/admin/` (accessible via `/admin/`)

### Remaining Considerations
- `includes/` directory still contains legacy auth files (in use)
- Some references to old paths may exist in documentation
- Consider adding `.gitignore` entries for removed directories
