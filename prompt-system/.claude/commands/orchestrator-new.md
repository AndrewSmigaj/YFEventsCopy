# Start New Orchestrated Task

I'll help you tackle this task using an uncertainty-driven, phase-based approach. Let me initialize a new task chain.

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

### 🎯 Initializing Orchestration Chain

I'm setting up a structured approach to handle your request through the following phases:

1. **Requirements Clarification** - Ensure I understand exactly what you need
2. **Context Building** - Discover relevant code, patterns, and constraints  
3. **Uncertainty Analysis** - Identify what I'm confident about vs what needs exploration
4. **Solution Design** - Synthesize an approach based on discoveries
5. **Implementation** - Execute with TDD and quality checks

### 📋 Phase 1: Requirements Clarification

Let me analyze your request for potential ambiguities:

**Analyzing**: "$ARGUMENTS"

Key questions to consider:
- Are there any vague terms that need specific definitions?
- What are the explicit and implicit constraints?
- What's the scope boundary?
- Are there any performance or security requirements?
- What's the success criteria?

**Initial observations**:
[I'll analyze the specific request and identify any ambiguities]

### 🔍 What I need to understand:

1. **Technical specifics**: [List any unclear technical aspects]
2. **Scope boundaries**: [What's included/excluded]
3. **Integration points**: [What systems/modules are affected]
4. **Constraints**: [Time, performance, compatibility]

### 💭 Initial Confidence Assessment

- Requirements clarity: [X%]
- Technical approach: [X%]  
- Implementation details: [X%]

### 🚀 Next Steps

To proceed effectively, I can:

**Option A**: If requirements are clear (>80% confidence)
- Move directly to context building phase
- Start discovering relevant code and patterns

**Option B**: If clarification needed (<80% confidence)  
- Ask specific clarifying questions
- Provide examples of what I understand vs what's unclear

**Option C**: Start with exploration
- Begin examining the codebase to inform questions
- Build context to ask better questions

Which approach would you prefer? Or would you like to add any specific requirements or constraints before we proceed?
