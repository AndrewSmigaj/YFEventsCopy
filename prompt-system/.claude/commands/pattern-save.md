# Save Pattern from Successful Chain

I'll analyze this chain to extract reusable patterns for future similar tasks.

## üîç Analyzing Current Chain

Looking at the current execution to identify:
- What worked well
- Key decision points
- Reusable approaches
- Effective prompt sequences

## üìä Pattern Extraction

### Problem Type
**Category**: [Authentication/CRUD/Integration/Refactoring/etc]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Domain**: [Web/API/Database/etc]

### Successful Approach
**Phase progression**:
1. Requirements: [What clarifications were key]
2. Discovery: [What exploration revealed insights]
3. Design: [What decisions were crucial]
4. Implementation: [What patterns worked]

### Key Discoveries
- [Discovery 1]: [Why it mattered]
- [Discovery 2]: [Why it mattered]
- [Discovery 3]: [Why it mattered]

### Effective Prompt Sequence
1. `[prompt_name]` ‚Üí Revealed [what]
2. `[prompt_name]` ‚Üí Clarified [what]
3. `[prompt_name]` ‚Üí Designed [what]

### Decision Points
**[Decision 1]**:
- Context: [When this came up]
- Choice: [What was chosen]
- Rationale: [Why it worked]

**[Decision 2]**:
- Context: [When this came up]
- Choice: [What was chosen]
- Rationale: [Why it worked]

## üéØ Pattern Definition

### Pattern Name
"[Descriptive pattern name]"

### When to Apply
This pattern works well when:
- [ ] [Condition 1]
- [ ] [Condition 2]
- [ ] [Condition 3]

### Pattern Structure
```yaml
pattern:
  name: "[Pattern name]"
  problem_indicators:
    - "[Indicator 1]"
    - "[Indicator 2]"
  
  solution_template:
    phase_1_requirements:
      - focus_on: "[Key areas]"
      - clarify: "[Common ambiguities]"
      
    phase_2_discovery:
      - explore: "[Critical areas]"
      - map: "[Important relationships]"
      
    phase_3_design:
      - decide: "[Key architecture choices]"
      - plan: "[Implementation approach]"
      
    phase_4_implementation:
      - start_with: "[Foundation elements]"
      - test_strategy: "[Approach]"
  
  typical_prompts:
    - "[prompt_1]"
    - "[prompt_2]"
    - "[prompt_3]"
    
  common_pitfalls:
    - "[Pitfall to avoid]"
    - "[Pitfall to avoid]"
    
  success_metrics:
    - "[How to measure success]"
    - "[How to measure success]"
```

## üí° Reusability Assessment

### Generalization Potential
**High**: Can apply to many similar problems
**Medium**: Useful for specific category
**Low**: Very context-specific

### Adaptation Points
Where this pattern can be customized:
- [Customization point 1]
- [Customization point 2]

### Prerequisites
This pattern assumes:
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

## üìà Effectiveness Metrics

From this execution:
- Time to solution: [X hours/days]
- Confidence progression: [X%] ‚Üí [Y%] ‚Üí [Z%]
- Prompts used: [N]
- Decisions made: [M]
- Rework needed: [Minimal/Some/Significant]

## üîÑ Future Application

### Quick Start
When encountering similar problem:
1. Check for [these indicators]
2. Start with [this prompt]
3. Focus on [these decisions]

### Time Savers
- Skip [unnecessary exploration]
- Reuse [design decision]
- Apply [implementation pattern]

### Watch Out For
- [Context-specific gotcha]
- [Common misapplication]

## üíæ Save Pattern?

**Pattern Quality**: [Excellent/Good/Fair]
**Reuse Likelihood**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Recommendation**: [Save/Refine/Discard]

Should I save this pattern to the patterns library for future use?

**Pattern file would be saved as**: `patterns/[pattern-name].yaml`
