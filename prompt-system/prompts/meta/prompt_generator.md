# Dynamic Prompt Generator

I need to create a new prompt to address a specific gap in our current prompt library.

**Gap identified**: [Description of what's missing]
**Context needed**: [What information the prompt should extract]
**Similar prompts**: [Existing prompts that are related but insufficient]

## 1. Prompt Requirements Analysis

### What This Prompt Needs to Do
**Primary purpose**: [Main objective]
**Secondary goals**: 
- [Additional objective 1]
- [Additional objective 2]

### Information to Extract
**Must discover**:
- [Critical information 1]
- [Critical information 2]

**Should discover**:
- [Useful information 1]
- [Useful information 2]

**Nice to have**:
- [Optional information]

### Success Criteria
The prompt succeeds when:
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] Uncertainty reduced from X% to Y%

## 2. Prompt Design

### Structure Selection
**Best format for this need**:
- [ ] Analysis prompt (systematic examination)
- [ ] Discovery prompt (exploration and mapping)
- [ ] Validation prompt (checking and verification)
- [ ] Synthesis prompt (combining information)
- [ ] Generation prompt (creating new content)

### Key Sections Needed
1. **Context gathering**: What background to collect
2. **Analysis method**: How to examine the subject
3. **Output format**: How to present findings
4. **Confidence metrics**: How to measure success

## 3. Generated Prompt

### Metadata
```yaml
---
name: [descriptive_snake_case_name]
purpose: [One line description]
good_for:
  - [Use case 1]
  - [Use case 2]
  - [Use case 3]
uncertainty_reduction:
  - [What uncertainty it addresses]
  - [What knowledge it provides]
cost_estimate: [low|medium|high]
---
```

### Prompt Content
```markdown
