I'm analyzing a completed task chain to extract reusable patterns and lessons learned.

**Chain to analyze**: [Chain ID and description]
**Outcome**: [Success/Partial/Failed]

## 1. Chain Overview

### Task Characteristics
**Problem type**: [Category - Auth/CRUD/Integration/etc]

**Novel aspects**: [What was unique]
**Standard aspects**: [What was typical]

### Execution Summary
- Total duration: [Time]
- Phases completed: [List]
- Major pivots: [Any direction changes]
- Final confidence: [X%]

## 2. Phase Analysis

### Requirements Phase
**Duration**: [Time]
**Key activities**:
- [Activity 1]: [Outcome]
- [Activity 2]: [Outcome]

**Critical discoveries**:
- [Discovery]: [Why it mattered]
- [Discovery]: [Why it mattered]

**Pattern**: [What approach worked well]

### Discovery Phase
**Duration**: [Time]
**Prompts used**:
- `[prompt_name]`: [What it revealed]
- `[prompt_name]`: [What it revealed]

**Breakthrough moments**:
- When examining [what], found [insight]
- When analyzing [what], realized [insight]

**Pattern**: [Effective discovery sequence]

### Design Phase
**Duration**: [Time]
**Key decisions**:
- [Decision]: [Rationale] → [Outcome]
- [Decision]: [Rationale] → [Outcome]

**Trade-offs made**:
- Chose [A] over [B] because [reason]
- Prioritized [X] at the cost of [Y]

**Pattern**: [Decision framework that worked]

### Implementation Phase
**Duration**: [Time]
**Approach**:
- Started with: [What and why]
- Testing strategy: [What worked]
- Iteration pattern: [How progress was made]

**Challenges overcome**:
- [Challenge]: [Solution]
- [Challenge]: [Solution]

**Pattern**: [Implementation strategy]

## 3. Prompt Effectiveness

### High-Value Prompts
**[prompt_name]**:
- Uncertainty reduction: [X%]
- Key insights: [What it revealed]
- When to use: [Conditions]

**[prompt_name]**:
- Uncertainty reduction: [X%]
- Key insights: [What it revealed]
- When to use: [Conditions]

### Prompt Sequences That Worked
```
1. [prompt_a] → discovered [X]
2. [prompt_b] → clarified [Y]
3. [prompt_c] → enabled [Z]
```

### Ineffective Prompts
- [prompt_name]: [Why it didn't help]
- [prompt_name]: [Why it was redundant]

## 4. Decision Patterns

### Successful Decision Framework
**When facing [type of choice]**:
1. Consider [factor 1]
2. Evaluate [factor 2]
3. Choose based on [criterion]

**Example from this chain**:
- Situation: [Context]
- Applied framework: [How]
- Result: [Outcome]

### Key Decision Points
1. **[Decision moment]**
   - Options: [A, B, C]
   - Chose: [Which]
   - Why: [Reasoning]
   - Reusable insight: [Principle]
