# Strategic Chain Planning

I'll analyze the current uncertainties and plan an optimal chain of 3-5 prompts to execute as a batch for maximum uncertainty reduction.

**Current Context**: [Phase, confidence levels, key uncertainties]

## 1. Uncertainty Assessment

### Primary Uncertainties
Based on current confidence scores and discoveries:

**Most Critical** (blocking progress):
1. [Uncertainty]: Impact on [what]
2. [Uncertainty]: Impact on [what]

**Secondary** (affecting design):
1. [Uncertainty]: Impact on [what]
2. [Uncertainty]: Impact on [what]

**Minor** (implementation details):
1. [Uncertainty]: Can resolve during coding

## 2. Chain Strategy

### For Current Phase: [Phase Name]

**Objective**: [What this chain should accomplish]

**Strategy**: [Sequential discovery | Parallel exploration | Deep dive]

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Confidence increase: [X%] â†’ [Y%]
- Key discoveries: [What we'll learn]
- Decisions enabled: [What we can decide after]

## 3. Optimal Prompt Chain

Based on uncertainty analysis and phase objectives:

### ðŸ”— Recommended Chain (3-5 prompts):

**Prompt 1**: `[prompt_name]`
- Purpose: [What it discovers]
- Reduces uncertainty: [Which ones]
- Feeds into: Next prompts

**Prompt 2**: `[prompt_name]`
- Purpose: [What it discovers]
- Builds on: Previous findings
- Reduces uncertainty: [Which ones]

**Prompt 3**: `[prompt_name]`
- Purpose: [What it discovers]
- Synthesizes: Previous discoveries
- Reduces uncertainty: [Which ones]

**Prompt 4**: `[prompt_name]` (if needed)
- Purpose: [Deep dive on specific area]
- Validates: Assumptions from 1-3
- Reduces uncertainty: [Which ones]

**Prompt 5**: `[prompt_name]` (if needed)
- Purpose: [Final validation/synthesis]
- Completes: Understanding
- Reduces uncertainty: [Which ones]

## 4. Chain Execution Order

The optimal order considering dependencies:

```
1. [prompt_1] â†’ Establishes foundation
   â†“
2. [prompt_2] â†’ Builds on foundation
   â†“
3. [prompt_3] â†’ Explores specific paths
   â†“
4. [prompt_4] â†’ Validates approach
   â†“
5. [prompt_5] â†’ Synthesizes findings
```

## 5. Alternative Chains

If primary chain doesn't fit:

### Alternative A: Quick Discovery
- `[prompt_1]`, `[prompt_2]`, `[prompt_3]`
- For when time is limited
- Covers essential uncertainties

### Alternative B: Deep Technical
- `[prompt_1]`, `[prompt_2]`, `[prompt_3]`, `[prompt_4]`
- For complex technical uncertainties
- Thorough architecture understanding

### Alternative C: Requirements Focus
- `[prompt_1]`, `[prompt_2]`, `[prompt_3]`
- For ambiguous requirements
- Clarifies before technical discovery

## 6. Success Metrics

This chain will be successful if:
- âœ“ Confidence increases by at least 30%
- âœ“ Critical uncertainties resolved
- âœ“ Next phase requirements met
- âœ“ Clear path forward identified

## 7. Post-Chain Actions

After executing this chain:
1. Run uncertainty analysis
2. If confidence < 80%, plan follow-up chain
3. If confidence â‰¥ 80%, proceed to next phase
4. Document key decisions

## 8. Execution Recommendation

**Ready to execute chain?**

The planned chain will:
- Take approximately [X] prompts
- Focus on [key area]
- Resolve [N] critical uncertainties
- Enable [next action]

**Suggested command**:
```
/execute-chain [prompt_1] [prompt_2] [prompt_3] [prompt_4] [prompt_5]
```

This chain is optimized for your current uncertainties and will provide maximum information gain with minimal prompt execution.
