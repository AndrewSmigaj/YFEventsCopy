# New Case Analysis

I'm analyzing a new task to establish initial understanding and identify areas that need exploration.

**Task**: [User-provided description]

## 1. Task Decomposition

**Core Ask**: What is the fundamental thing being requested?
- Primary goal:
- Secondary objectives:
- Nice-to-haves:

**Scope Boundaries**: What's included vs excluded?
- Definitely included:
- Definitely excluded:
- Unclear/needs clarification:

## 2. Initial Technical Analysis

**System Impact**:
- Components to modify:
- Components to create:
- Components to integrate with:

**Data Flow**:
- Input sources:
- Processing steps:
- Output destinations:

**User Journey**:
- Who interacts with this:
- How they interact:
- What they expect:

## 3. Requirement Categories

**Functional Requirements**:
- Must have:
- Should have:
- Could have:

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Performance:
- Security:
- Usability:
- Maintainability:

## 4. Initial Uncertainties

**High Priority** (blocks progress):
- [ ] [Specific uncertainty]
- [ ] [Specific uncertainty]

**Medium Priority** (affects design):
- [ ] [Specific uncertainty]
- [ ] [Specific uncertainty]

**Low Priority** (can defer):
- [ ] [Specific uncertainty]

## 5. Knowledge Gaps

What I need to discover:
- About the existing system:
- About the requirements:
- About constraints:
- About integration:

## 6. Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- Complexity:
- Integration:
- Performance:

**Project Risks**:
- Scope creep:
- Timeline:
- Dependencies:

## 7. Initial Approach

**Proposed strategy**:
1. [First major step]
2. [Second major step]
3. [Third major step]

**Key decisions needed**:
- [Decision point 1]
- [Decision point 2]

## 8. Next Actions

**Immediate needs**:
1. Clarify: [specific ambiguities]
2. Discover: [specific code/patterns]
3. Validate: [specific assumptions]

**Recommended prompts**:
- For requirements: requirement_disambiguator
- For code discovery: trace_existing_flow
- For architecture: component_mapper

## Initial Confidence Assessment

- Requirements understanding: [X]%
- Technical approach: [X]%
- Implementation path: [X]%
- **Overall confidence**: [X]%

**Recommendation**: [Continue to specific phase based on confidence]
