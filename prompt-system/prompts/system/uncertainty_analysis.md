# Comprehensive Uncertainty Analysis

I'm analyzing all dimensions of uncertainty to determine our readiness to proceed and identify what needs further exploration.

**Current Context**: [Task and discoveries so far]

## 1. Uncertainty Inventory

### Requirements Uncertainties
**Well Understood** (>90% confident):
- [Specific requirement]
- [Specific requirement]

**Moderately Clear** (70-90% confident):
- [Requirement]: Missing [specific detail]
- [Requirement]: Unclear about [aspect]

**Poorly Understood** (<70% confident):
- [Requirement]: Need to clarify [what]
- [Requirement]: Ambiguous because [reason]

### Technical Uncertainties
**Architecture**:
- [ ] Overall system design approach
- [ ] Component responsibilities
- [ ] Integration patterns
- [ ] Data flow architecture

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Code organization strategy
- [ ] Framework/library choices
- [ ] Testing approach
- [ ] Error handling patterns

**Operations**:
- [ ] Deployment process
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] Monitoring needs
- [ ] Rollback procedures

## 2. Confidence Scoring

### Dimensional Analysis
**Requirements Dimension**:
- Functional requirements: [X]%
- Non-functional requirements: [X]%
- Constraints understanding: [X]%
- Success criteria: [X]%
- **Weighted average**: [X]%

**Technical Dimension**:
- Architecture fitness: [X]%
- Technology decisions: [X]%
- Integration approach: [X]%
- Performance strategy: [X]%
- **Weighted average**: [X]%

**Implementation Dimension**:
- Code structure: [X]%
- Testing strategy: [X]%
- Error handling: [X]%
- Edge cases: [X]%
- **Weighted average**: [X]%

### Overall Confidence Score: [X]%

## 3. Uncertainty Impact Analysis

### Critical Uncertainties (Blockers)
**[Uncertainty 1]**:
- Impact: [How it blocks progress]
- Resolution: [What would resolve it]
- Priority: CRITICAL

**[Uncertainty 2]**:
- Impact: [How it blocks progress]
- Resolution: [What would resolve it]
- Priority: CRITICAL

### Important Uncertainties (Design Affecting)
**[Uncertainty 3]**:
- Impact: [How it affects design]
- Resolution: [What would help]
- Priority: HIGH

### Minor Uncertainties (Implementation Details)
**[Uncertainty 4]**:
- Impact: [Minor effect]
- Resolution: [Can decide during coding]
- Priority: LOW

## 4. Knowledge Gap Analysis

**What we know**:
- [Confident assertion]
- [Confident assertion]
- [Confident assertion]

**What we think we know** (assumptions to validate):
- [Assumption]: Based on [evidence]
- [Assumption]: Based on [evidence]

**What we don't know**:
- [Knowledge gap]: Need to [discover how]
- [Knowledge gap]: Need to [discover how]

**What we don't know we don't know** (potential blind spots):
- [Area]: Haven't explored [aspect]
- [Area]: May be missing [consideration]

## 5. Resolution Strategies

### For Each Critical Uncertainty:

**[Critical Uncertainty 1]**:
1. Run prompt: [specific prompt name]
2. Examine: [specific files/areas]
3. Ask user: [specific question]

**[Critical Uncertainty 2]**:
1. Analyze: [what to analyze]
2. Test assumption: [how to test]
3. Validate with: [validation method]

## 6. Confidence Thresholds

**Ready to proceed** (>80% overall):
- Can synthesize solution
- Minor uncertainties manageable
- Clear implementation path

**Need targeted discovery** (60-80%):
- Address critical uncertainties
- Run specific prompts
- 1-2 more discovery rounds

**Need comprehensive exploration** (<60%):
- Major knowledge gaps
- Possibly novel problem
- Need systematic discovery

## 7. Recommended Actions

**Based on [X]% confidence**:

**Option A**: Proceed to solution design
- We understand enough to design
- Remaining uncertainties are minor
- Can refine during implementation

**Option B**: Targeted discovery
- Focus on: [specific uncertainties]
- Use prompts: [specific prompts]
- Then re-assess

**Option C**: Comprehensive discovery
- Start with: [discovery area]
- May need: [new prompts/approaches]
- Break into smaller problems

**Option D**: User clarification needed
- Ask about: [specific questions]
- Provide context: [why it matters]
- Suggest options: [possible approaches]

## 8. Uncertainty Tracking

**For context file**:
```json
{
  "uncertainties": [
    {
      "id": "U001",
      "description": "[uncertainty]",
      "impact": "critical|high|low",
      "confidence": 0.X,
      "resolution_strategy": "[approach]",
      "resolved": false
    }
  ],
  "confidence_scores": {
    "requirements": 0.X,
    "technical": 0.X,
    "implementation": 0.X,
    "overall": 0.X
  }
}
```

**Next Step**: [Specific recommendation based on analysis]
