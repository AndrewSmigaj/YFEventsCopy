- **Scraper Types**:
  - HTML scraping with DOM parsing
  - iCal format processing
  - JSON API consumption
  - Intelligent scraping with LLM integration
- **Queue Management**: Batch processing with rate limiting

#### 3. Module Architecture
Each module follows a standardized structure:
```

## Architectural Comparison

### Control Flow Evolution

#### Traditional Flow (Main Branch)
```
User Request 
  → Apache mod_php
    → Direct PHP file (calendar.php)
      → Include configuration
        → Instantiate Model
          → Direct SQL query
            → Process results
              → Echo HTML output
```

#### Clean Architecture Flow (Refactor Branch)
```
User Request
  → Front Controller (index.php)
    → Router
      → Middleware Stack
        → Controller
          → Service Layer
            → Repository Interface
              → Domain Entity
                → Response Transformer
                  → JSON/HTML Response
```

### Dependency Direction

#### Main Branch (Bottom-up)
```
Database ← Model ← Controller ← View
```

#### Refactor Branch (Top-down)
```
Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation
         ↓              ↓                ↓
      Use Cases    Repositories      Controllers
```

## System Boundaries

### Main Branch Boundaries

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Direct file access (calendar.php, admin/*.php)
   - Inline HTML generation
   - AJAX endpoints in separate directories

2. **Business Logic**
   - Mixed between models and procedural code
   - Validation scattered across layers
   - Business rules in SQL queries

3. **Data Access**
   - Direct PDO calls in models
   - SQL queries embedded in PHP
   - No abstraction layer

### Refactored Architecture Boundaries

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Centralized routing
   - Template rendering
   - API versioning support

2. **Application Layer**
   - Use case orchestration
   - Input validation
   - DTO transformations

3. **Domain Layer**
   - Pure business logic
   - Entity relationships
   - Domain events

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Database implementations
   - External service adapters
   - Framework integrations

## Design Patterns

### Patterns in Main Branch

1. **Active Record**
   - Models contain data and behavior
   - Direct database access
   - Example: EventModel, ShopModel

2. **Factory Pattern**
   - ScraperFactory for creating scrapers
   - Strategy selection based on source type

3. **Singleton**
   - Database connection management
   - Configuration loading

4. **Template Method**
   - BaseModel abstract class
   - Scraper base implementations

### Patterns in Refactor Branch

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Interface-based data access
   - Swappable implementations
   - Testing-friendly design

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Constructor injection
   - Interface programming
   - IoC container

3. **Command/Query Separation**
   - Read models vs write models
   - Optimized query paths

4. **Domain Events**
   - Event sourcing ready
   - Decoupled components
   - Audit trail support

5. **Value Objects**
   - Type safety
   - Business rule encapsulation
   - Immutable data

## Technical Debt Assessment

## Conclusion

The YFEvents repository demonstrates a system in active evolution from traditional PHP patterns toward modern clean architecture. While the main branch serves current production needs, the refactor branch shows the desired future state. The feature branches explore specific domain enhancements that could be integrated into either architecture.

The modular design is a particular strength, allowing incremental improvements without system-wide rewrites. However, the current state with multiple architectural approaches across branches requires consolidation to prevent technical debt accumulation.

The recommended path forward is to:
1. Stabilize the current production system
2. Choose a primary architectural direction
3. Create a gradual migration plan
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
5. Focus on test coverage and documentation

This analysis provides the foundation for informed architectural decisions and strategic planning for the YFEvents platform evolution.
