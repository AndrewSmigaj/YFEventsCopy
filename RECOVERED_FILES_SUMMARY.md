# Recovered Files Summary

Date: July 12, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the files that were deleted in commit 39b8e7b ("feat: Restore Clean Architecture system files") and subsequently recovered.

## Files Recovered

### 1. Context Engineering System ✅
- `/context_engineering/llm-orchestrated-prompt-system.md` - Complete LLM orchestration documentation
- `/context_engineering/component_linkage_map.json` - Component mapping for the system
- `/prompt-system/` - Directory containing prompt library and Claude commands
- `/.claude/` - Claude-specific settings and rules
- `/contexts/` - Chain-specific context files

### 2. Critical Documentation ✅
- `architecture.yaml` - Comprehensive system architecture (v2.3.0)
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_SIMPLE.md` - Simplified deployment guide
- `ROUTING_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation of routing fixes
- `context.json` - Component linkage information

### 3. Database Documentation ✅
- `database/CURRENT_DATABASE_STATE.md` - Current state of database tables
- `database/INSTALL_ORDER.md` - Correct order for installing database schemas
- `database/TABLE_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of database tables and relationships

### 4. Configuration Files ✅
- `config/app.php` - Application configuration
- `config/bootstrap.php` - Bootstrap configuration
- `config/container.php` - Dependency injection container
- `config/services/` - Service configuration directory
- `composer.lock` - Locked dependency versions

## Impact Analysis

The commit 39b8e7b deleted **151 files** total, including:
- All context engineering and prompt orchestration work
- Comprehensive documentation about the system
- Configuration files for the modern architecture
- Database migration and analysis files
- Test results and analysis

## What Was NOT Recovered

Some files were intentionally not recovered as they may conflict with the current system:
- Various backup files
- Temporary analysis files
- Some database migration files that might cause conflicts

## Recommendations

1. Review the recovered files to ensure they don't conflict with current system
2. Consider merging useful documentation into the main CLAUDE.md file
3. The context engineering system should be preserved as it's a valuable development tool
4. Update deployment scripts to handle the database foreign key issues we discovered

## Next Steps

- Commit these recovered files to preserve them
- Update DEPLOY_ROBUST.sh with the database import fixes
- Consider integrating the context engineering system into the development workflow
