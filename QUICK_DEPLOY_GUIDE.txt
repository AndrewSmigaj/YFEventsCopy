YFEVENTS QUICK DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR UBUNTU 22.04
================================================

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD AND RUN SERVER SETUP
-------------------------------------

# You can run this from any directory (typically your home directory after SSH login)
cd ~

# Download the setup script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewSmigaj/YFEventsCopy/refactor/unified-structure/scripts/deploy/setup-server.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x setup-server.sh

# Run the setup
sudo ./setup-server.sh

When prompted, provide:
- Domain name: smigaj.com (or your domain)
- Email for SSL: smigaja@gmail.com 
- MySQL password for yfevents user: Choose a secure password and remember it!


STEP 2: CLONE AND DEPLOY
------------------------

# Stay in your home directory (or any directory - doesn't matter)
# The clone command will create /var/www/yfevents automatically

# Clone the repository with the correct branch
git clone -b refactor/unified-structure https://github.com/AndrewSmigaj/YFEventsCopy.git /var/www/yfevents

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd /var/www/yfevents

# Pull latest fixes (important!)
git pull origin refactor/unified-structure

# Create deployment config from example
cp config/deployment/deployment.yaml.example config/deployment/deployment.yaml

# Run the deployment (from the yfevents directory)
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh


STEP 3: WHEN PROMPTED DURING DEPLOYMENT
---------------------------------------

The deploy script will ask for:
- Database password: Use the same password you created in Step 1
- Admin user: Create your admin account when prompted


THAT'S IT!
----------

Your site should be available at https://smigaj.com once DNS propagates.

Notes:
- The setup script handles Apache, PHP 8.1, MySQL, SSL certificates automatically
- The deployment script will set up the database, configure the app, and create cron jobs
- If you see any errors, just let me know!
