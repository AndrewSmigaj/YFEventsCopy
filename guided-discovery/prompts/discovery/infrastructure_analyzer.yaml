  # Infrastructure Analysis for Deployment
  
  I need to analyze the infrastructure requirements and configuration for deployment.
  
  **Task Context**: {{task.description}}
  
  ## Discovery Goals
  
  1. **Server Infrastructure**
     - Operating system requirements
     - Web server configuration needs
     - PHP version and extensions
     - Database server requirements
     - Required system services
  
  2. **Deployment Configuration**
     - Application directory structure
     - File permissions and ownership
     - Environment configuration approach
     - Sensitive data handling
     - SSL/TLS requirements
  
  3. **Security Infrastructure**
     - Firewall configuration
     - SSH access controls
     - Application security measures
     - Database security
     - API key protection
  
  4. **Deployment Process**
     - Code deployment method
     - Dependency installation
     - Database migration approach
     - Configuration management
     - Service restart procedures
  
  5. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
     - Log file locations and rotation
     - Health check endpoints
     - Backup strategies
     - Update procedures
  
  Look for:
  - Existing deployment scripts
  - Server configuration files
  - Environment configuration examples
  - Security best practices in code
  - Infrastructure documentation
  
  ## Structured Output
  
  After analysis, I'll provide findings in this structure:
  
  ### INFRASTRUCTURE_REQUIREMENTS
  - OS: [version and distribution]
  - Web_Server: [type and version]
  - PHP: [version and required extensions]
  - Database: [type and version]
  - Other_Services: [list of required services]
  
  ### DEPLOYMENT_CONFIGURATION
  - App_Directory: [path]
  - Document_Root: [path]
  - Permissions: [user/group requirements]
  - Config_Method: [how configuration is handled]
  
  ### SECURITY_SETUP
  - Firewall: [ports and rules]
  - SSL: [certificate approach]
  - Access_Control: [SSH, sudo requirements]
  - Secrets_Management: [how secrets are handled]
  
  ### DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS
  - Method: [git, rsync, etc.]
  - Steps: [ordered list of deployment steps]
  - Rollback: [rollback strategy]
  
  ### MONITORING
  - Logs: [locations and types]
  - Health: [monitoring approach]
  - Alerts: [alerting strategy]
