  # General Codebase Exploration
  
  I need to understand the overall structure and technology of this codebase.
  
  **Task Context**: {{task.description}}
  
  ## Discovery Goals
  
  1. **Project Structure**
     - Main directories and their purposes
     - Key entry points (main, index, app, server files)
     - Configuration files
     - Module/package organization
  
  2. **Technology Stack**
     - Programming languages used
     - Major frameworks and libraries
     - Build tools and package managers
     - Database systems
  
  3. **Architecture Pattern**
     - Overall architecture style (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
     - How components communicate
     - Request flow pattern
  
  4. **Development Setup**
     - How to run the project
     - Test setup
     - Build process
     - Environment configuration
  
  Please explore the codebase and provide findings in this structure:
  
  ### PROJECT_STRUCTURE
  - Root: [main directory path]
  - Entry: [main entry file(s)]
  - Key_Dirs:
    - [directory]: [purpose]
  - Config_Files: [list main config files]
  
  ### TECHNOLOGY_STACK  
  - Languages: [list with versions if found]
  - Framework: [main framework]
  - Database: [database type]
  - Build_Tool: [build/bundler]
  
  ### ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN
  - Style: [architecture style]
  - Components: [main components]
  - Flow: [request flow description]
  
  ### DEVELOPMENT_SETUP
  - Run: [how to run]
  - Test: [test command]
  - Build: [build command]
