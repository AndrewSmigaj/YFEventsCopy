  # General Codebase Exploration

  I need to understand the overall structure and technology of this codebase.

  Task: {{task.description}}

  ## Discovery Goals

  1. **Project Structure**
   - Main directories and their purposes
   - Key entry points (main, index, app, server files)
   - Configuration files
   - Module/package organization

  2. **Technology Stack**
   - Programming languages used
   - Major frameworks and libraries
   - Build tools and package managers
   - Database systems

  3. **Architecture Pattern**
   - Overall architecture style (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
   - How components communicate
   - Request flow pattern

  4. **Development Setup**
   - How to run the project
   - Test setup
   - Build process
   - Environment configuration

  ## Structured Output

  After exploration, I'll update the context with discoveries:

  ### DISCOVERIES
  ```json
  {
  "discoveries": {
    "architecture": {
      "style": "MVC|microservices|layered|etc",
      "main_components": ["component1", "component2"],
      "communication_pattern": "REST|RPC|events|etc"
    },
    "technical": {
      "languages": ["language1", "language2"],
      "framework": "framework_name",
      "database": "database_type",
      "build_tools": ["tool1", "tool2"]
    },
    "project": {
      "root_directory": "path",
      "entry_points": ["file1", "file2"],
      "key_directories": {
        "src": "source code",
        "tests": "test files"
      }
    },
    "development": {
      "run_command": "npm start",
      "test_command": "npm test",
      "build_command": "npm build"
    }
  }
  }
  ```

  ### UNCERTAINTY_UPDATES
  - ARCH-001 (Overall architecture): Will be resolved/partial based on findings
  - TECH-001 (Technology stack): Will be resolved/partial based on findings
