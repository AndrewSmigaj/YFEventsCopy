  # Task Intent Analysis
  
  Before selecting discovery chains, I need to understand what the user is truly asking for.
  
  **Task Description**: {{task.description}}
  **Task Type**: {{task.type}}
  
  ## Intent Analysis
  
  Let me analyze the key action words and context:
  
  ### Action Words Found
  [Identify verbs and intent indicators in the task description]
  
  ### Primary Intent Categories
  
  **CREATION** (Build something new):
  - Keywords: create, build, implement, develop, design, make, construct
  - Example: "Create a deployment script for..."
  - Chain types needed: design, architecture, planning chains
  
  **VALIDATION** (Check existing things):
  - Keywords: ensure, validate, check, verify, test, confirm, review
  - Example: "Ensure the deployment script is correct"
  - Chain types needed: validation, review, testing chains
  
  **DEBUGGING** (Fix problems):
  - Keywords: fix, debug, resolve, troubleshoot, solve, repair
  - Example: "Fix the authentication issue in..."
  - Chain types needed: debugging, analysis, root-cause chains
  
  **ANALYSIS** (Understand something):
  - Keywords: analyze, understand, explore, investigate, examine, study
  - Example: "Analyze the codebase architecture"
  - Chain types needed: discovery, analysis, exploration chains
  
  **OPTIMIZATION** (Improve existing):
  - Keywords: optimize, improve, enhance, refactor, upgrade, modernize
  - Example: "Optimize the database queries"
  - Chain types needed: performance, refactoring, improvement chains
  
  ### My Assessment
  
  Based on "{{task.description}}", the primary intent is:
  
  **[INTENT_CATEGORY]** because [explanation based on keywords and context]
  
  ### Secondary Intents
  [Any additional intents detected]
  
  ### What Success Looks Like
  For this intent, success means:
  - [Specific outcome 1]
  - [Specific outcome 2]
  - [Specific outcome 3]
  
  ### Chain Selection Guidance
  
  For **[INTENT_CATEGORY]** tasks, I should look for chains that:
  - [Characteristic 1 of appropriate chains]
  - [Characteristic 2 of appropriate chains]
  - [Characteristic 3 of appropriate chains]
  
  I should AVOID chains that:
  - [What doesn't match this intent]
  - [Common mismatches to watch for]
  
  ### Intent Confidence
  
  My confidence in this intent analysis: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
  Reasoning: [Why I'm confident or uncertain]
