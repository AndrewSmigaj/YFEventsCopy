  # Chain Selection Validation
  
  Before proceeding, let me validate this chain selection makes sense.
  
  **Task**: {{task.description}}
  **Intent**: {{intent_summary.primary_intent}}
  **Selected Chain**: {{selected_chain.name}}
  **Match Score**: {{match_score}}/100
  
  ## Sanity Check Questions
  
  ### 1. The Obvious Test
  
  Reading the task again: "{{task.description}}"
  
  We're about to run: {{selected_chain.name}} - {{selected_chain.description}}
  
  **Does this make obvious sense?**
  [Step back and think: would a developer reading this think we're doing the right thing?]
  
  ### 2. The Outcome Test
  
  **What the user wants**: 
  [Restate in simple terms what outcome the user expects]
  
  **What this chain produces**:
  [What will we have after running this chain]
  
  **Do these align?** [YES/NO]
  
  ### 3. Common Mismatch Patterns
  
  Check for these red flags:
  
  - [ ] **Design/Create chain for validation task**: User wants to check/ensure something exists correctly, but chain creates new designs
  - [ ] **Validation chain for creation task**: User wants to build something new, but chain only validates existing things  
  - [ ] **Wrong domain**: Chain is for different technology/domain than the task
  - [ ] **Wrong phase**: Chain targets different phase than we're in
  - [ ] **Too generic**: Chain is too broad for specific task needs
  - [ ] **Too specific**: Chain is too narrow and will miss important aspects
  
  ### 4. The "What Would Help More" Test
  
  Instead of {{selected_chain.name}}, would any of these be better?
  
  - **Direct analysis**: Just analyze the code without a chain
  - **Custom prompts**: Create specific prompts for this exact need
  - **Different chain**: [Suggest specific alternative if applicable]
  - **Multiple chains**: Run several chains in sequence
  
  ### 5. Risk Assessment
  
  **If we proceed with {{selected_chain.name}}**:
  
  Likely outcomes:
  - BEST case: [what happens if it works perfectly]
  - LIKELY case: [realistic expectation]
  - WORST case: [what could go wrong]
  
  **Risk level**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
  
  ## VALIDATION_RESULT
  
  ```json
  {
    "chain": "{{selected_chain.name}}",
    "validation_passed": [true/false],
    "confidence": "[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]",
    "concerns": ["concern1", "concern2"],
    "recommendation": "[PROCEED/RECONSIDER/ABORT]",
    "alternative_suggestion": "[alternative approach if needed]",
    "reasoning": "[brief explanation of decision]"
  }
  ```
  
  ## Final Recommendation
  
  [Clear statement about whether to proceed or choose different approach]
  
  If PROCEED:
  "✅ This chain aligns well with the task intent. Proceed with {{selected_chain.name}}."
  
  If RECONSIDER:
  "⚠️ This chain might work but consider these alternatives: [list]"
  
  If ABORT:
  "❌ This chain doesn't match the task needs. Instead, try: [specific alternative]"
