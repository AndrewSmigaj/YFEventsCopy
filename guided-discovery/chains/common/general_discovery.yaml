description: Basic exploration chain for understanding codebase structure and technology
version: "1.0"
type: discovery

metadata:
  average_duration: 15-25 minutes
  complexity: simple
  effectiveness: 0.85

targets_phase: discovery
optimal_for:
  - Initial exploration
  - Understanding new codebases
  - General feature additions
  - Architecture discovery

targets_uncertainties:
  primary:
    - ARCH-001
    - TECH-001
  secondary:
    - IMPL-001
    - DEP-001

prompt_sequence:
  - prompt: general_explorer
    order: 1
    mandatory: true
    purpose: Get overview of codebase structure and tech stack
    
  - prompt: architecture_analyzer
    order: 2
    mandatory: true
    purpose: Understand architectural patterns and component organization
    
  - prompt: dependency_mapper
    order: 3
    mandatory: false
    purpose: Map internal and external dependencies
    condition: "complexity != 'simple'"
    
  - prompt: tech_stack_identifier
    order: 4
    mandatory: false
    purpose: Deep dive into technology choices
    condition: "task.type == 'feature' || uncertainties.TECH-001.confidence < 0.5"

success_criteria:
  min_confidence_gain: 0.35
  required_discoveries:
    - architecture.style
    - technical.languages
    - technical.framework
  optional_discoveries:
    - dependencies.external
    - architecture.patterns

next_chain_logic:
  - condition: "task.description contains 'auth' || task.description contains 'security'"
    next_chain: auth_discovery
    reason: "Authentication-related task detected"
    
  - condition: "confidence.overall < 0.6"
    next_chain: deep_analysis
    reason: "Need more detailed discovery"
    
  - condition: "confidence.overall >= 0.8"
    next_chain: solution_design
    reason: "Ready to design solution"
    
  - default: targeted_discovery
    reason: "Focus on remaining uncertainties"
