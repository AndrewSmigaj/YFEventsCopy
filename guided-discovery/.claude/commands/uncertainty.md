# Uncertainty Analysis

Analyze uncertainties to guide discovery and determine next steps.

```bash
# Parse subcommand
SUBCOMMAND="${ARGUMENTS%% *}"
ARGS="${ARGUMENTS#* }"

# If no subcommand, default to status
if [ -z "$SUBCOMMAND" ] || [ "$SUBCOMMAND" = "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
  SUBCOMMAND="status"
  ARGS=""
fi

# Find active context
CONTEXT_FILE=$(ls -t /mnt/d/YFEventsCopy/guided-discovery/contexts/active/*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1)

  echo "Start a new discovery with: /discover \"your task description\""
  exit 1

## How Claude Uses This Command

When you run `/uncertainty analyze`, Claude:

1. **Reads your entire context** - Task, phase, discoveries, uncertainties
2. **Assesses resolution status** - Which uncertainties are resolved/partial/unresolved
3. **Prioritizes by phase** - Discovery uncertainties first, then planning, etc.
4. **Considers dependencies** - Some uncertainties block others
5. **Recommends specific actions** - Chains, prompts, or phase transitions

The key is that Claude provides **dynamic analysis** based on your actual progress, not predetermined responses.

## Integration with Workflow

```bash
echo ""
echo "### Workflow Integration"
echo "1. After running chains/prompts: Check uncertainty status"
echo "2. Use analyze to get Claude's recommendations"
echo "3. Follow recommendations to resolve uncertainties"
echo "4. When uncertainties resolved, consider phase transition"
echo ""
echo "This creates an uncertainty-driven discovery loop!"
