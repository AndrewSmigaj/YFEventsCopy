# Guided Discovery System

A context engineering framework that transforms uncertainties into systematic understanding through human-AI collaboration.

## Quick Start

### 1. Begin a new task
```
/discover Create a deployment script for Digital Ocean
```

### 2. Execute recommended discovery
```
/chain tech_analysis 20250727-154946
```

### 3. Check your progress
```
/uncertainty review 20250727-154946
```

### 4. Continue exploration
```
/chain deployment_design 20250727-154946
```

## Core Commands

- `/discover` - Start new task and identify uncertainties
- `/chain [name] [id]` - Run discovery workflow
- `/uncertainty review [id]` - Check what's still unknown
- `/context phase [id]` - View current phase and progress

## How It Works

1. **Uncertainties drive everything** - We start by identifying what we don't know
2. **Discovery builds context** - Systematic exploration fills knowledge gaps  
3. **Phases gate progress** - Can't implement until we understand
4. **Context persists** - Knowledge accumulates across sessions

## Philosophy

> "The quality of AI output depends on the quality of context provided. This system makes context engineering systematic, transparent, and effective."

Built for Claude Code, applicable to any AI-assisted work.
